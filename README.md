# vim_config
This is my preferred Vim configuration. It includes:

    * Easy plugin management
    * Auto indentation using spaces instead of tabs
    * Syntax highlighting
    * Code folding
    * Code completion
    * Improved searching
    * And an additional number of small improvements, see the .vimrc!

## Installation
To install, simply run setup.sh
The setup may install some needed packages if they are not already installed.
This Vim configuration uses Vundle to manage plugins. The plugin installation will be done through Vim and may take some minutes to complete.

## Plugins
This configuration uses the following plugins:

    * [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
    * [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
    * [YCM-Generator](https://github.com/rdnetto/YCM-Generator)

## Usage
This configuration uses the standard Vim key mapping, except:

    * Press Enter after you are done with a search to turn of the search highlighting.

See the github pages for usage of the different plugins. This is recommended in order to use the code completion mechanism in an efficient way.

## Future features
 * I'm currently looking into more plugins to use for more IDE-like functionality in Vim.
 * Maybe some more convenient key mappings?
 * I will probably update the .vimrc with more tweaks and improvements.
